Dubbed versions were aired in Tamil, Telugu, and Indonesian in the early 1990s.\n\nAccording to production team member Kishore Malhotra, the total cost of producing the series was 90000000. It was aired in the premium Sunday morning time slot of 9:00 am – 10:00 am. The series was a runaway success and public places were often deserted during the broadcast. To ensure a good voter turnout in the central election one Sunday, the telecast was delayed to the evening. This is considered the definitive filmed version of the story. Nitish Bharadwaj, who portrayed Lord Krishna, was very popular and became a Member of the Indian Parliament.",
